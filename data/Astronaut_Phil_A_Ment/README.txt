# Summary

Introducing the new MatterHackers mascot: Phil A. Ment! Designed with troubleshooting in mind, Phil has several features specifically to put your printer through its paces. These features include: small inset details, small embossed details, overhangs, vertical and horizontal cylinders, fillets, chamfers, bridging, and even his perfectly domed helmet.

On a well calibrated 3D printer, this awesome little guy prints well at any scale; from 12 millimeters tall to 350!

Printed in MatterHackers PRO Series PLA at a 0.2mm layer height and 10% infill.
