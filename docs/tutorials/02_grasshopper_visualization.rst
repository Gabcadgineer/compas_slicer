Visualization in grasshopper
****************************

The usage of the slicing functionality of compas_slicer is explained in the examples. This tutorial gives
an overview of how the results of the slicing process can be visualized in Rhino grasshopper. It is important
to not that the grasshopper components do not run any slicing code, they merely visualize existing results.

* How to install (-reference to README) and verify that the grasshopper components have been installed
* How do grasshopper components work? (only visualization, load json files, no actual slicing code running on them)
* What components are available?
* What is the standard workflow with compas_slicer-grasshopper visualization?
